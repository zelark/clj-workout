;; Regular Expressions

;; Regex patterns are supported with a special reader macro.
(= "ABC" (apply str (re-seq #"[A-Z]+" "bA1B3Ce ")))


;; Simple Recursion
;;
;; A recursive function is a function which calls itself. This is one of
;; the fundamental techniques used in functional programming.
(= [5 4 3 2 1] ((fn foo [x] (when (> x 0) (conj (foo (dec x)) x))) 5))


;; Recurring Theme
;;
;; Clojure only has one non-stack-consuming looping construct: recur. 
;; Either a function or a loop can be used as the recursion point. 
;; Either way, recur rebinds the bindings of the recursion point to
;; the values it is passed.
;; Recur must be called from the tail-position, and calling it elsewhere
;; will result in an error.
(= [7 6 5 4 3]
  (loop [x 5
         result []]
    (if (> x 0)
      (recur (dec x) (conj result (+ 2 x)))
      result)))


;; Rearranging Code: ->
;;
;; The thread-first macro -> threads an expression x through a variable
;; number of forms. First, x is inserted as the second item in the first form,
;; making a list of it if it is not a list already. Then the first form is
;; inserted as the second item in the second form, making a list of that form
;; if necessary. This process continues for all the forms. Using thread-first
;; can sometimes make your code more readable.
(= (last (sort (rest (reverse [2 5 4 1 3 6]))))
   (-> [2 5 4 1 3 6] reverse rest sort last)

;; Rearranging Code: ->>
;;
;; The thread-last macro threads an expression x through a variable number
;; of forms. First, x is inserted as the last item in the first form, making
;; a list of it if it is not a list already. Then the first form is inserted
;; as the last item in the second form, making a list of that form if
;; necessary. This process continues for all the forms. Using thread-last
;; can sometimes make your code more readable.

;; For the win
;;
;; Clojureâ€™s for macro is a tremendously versatile mechanism for producing
;; a sequence based on some other sequence(s). It can take some time to
;; understand how to use it properly, but that investment will be paid back
;; with clear, concise sequence-wrangling later. With that in mind, read
;; over these for expressions and try to see how each of them produces the
;; same result.
